    <h1>my school work</h1>
    <p>my school work has been well and right now im passed numerecy level 1 and got 17 credits all together now, i was in a leadership group and it was entertaining and very helpful when learning how to lead, we also did a challenge with our groups where we had towalk through a forest without light and ll we had was a rope to guide us through the forest and there were challenges we has to face when going through th forest like potholes and other things we has to jump over and crawl under</p>
	
	<h1>Timetable</h1>
    <p>right now i am attending english classes, math classes, science classes, digital technology classes and physical education. 
	the reason for me joining theres classes because they align with my goal to one day be a mechanic. it might not seem like a high paying job but im only in it because i love cars.
	and i want to do what i love instead of living a boring life like the rest.</p>
	
	<p>i chose physical education to get some movement in and to keep myself healthy by having daily activities that require physical movement and also teamwork is a critical thing for mechanics becaus they have to work work with each other and comunicate about things that are damaged. but not only that they also need teamwork for other things like supporting each other when they ask and keeping the work environment positive that will also have a positive impact on the workers mood.</p>
