    <p>The Toyota Chaser is a mid-size car produced by Toyota in Japan. BBBBB
	Most Chasers are four-door sedans and hardtop sedans; a two-door hardtop coup√© was available on the first generation only. 
	It was introduced on the 1976 Toyota Corona Mark II platform, and was sold new by Toyota at Toyota Vista Store dealerships only in Japan, together with the Toyota Cresta. The Chaser was produced for six generations, and production ceased in 2001,
	when it was merged with the Cresta to form the short lived Verossa.

The Toyota Chaser has been known as one of the 'triplet sedans' of Toyota, because it shares the same chassis with the Toyota Cressida/Mark II, and the Cresta, and afforded Toyota the opportunity to sell one platform at several different dealership sales channels. 
At its introduction this series shared MacPherson struts for the front and rear suspension, using Semi-trailing arm suspension with 4 links for the rear suspension until production ended in 2001. The Chaser and its platform sisters are considered a class below the Crown, allowing Toyota to offer a sedan with similar levels of luxury content,
 yet offering buyers lower tax liability and a more sporty image with a slightly smaller body length.
